# spacemacs-InstallerAndConfig

This project contains an easy to use installer for the first class development environment spacemacs.
I have migrated from Netbeans, 2 Months ago and found installing all those little dependencies like sourceCodePro fonts or gnu global quite tedious.

So I have started to create a handy bash script that will install all the necessary dependencies to the system as well as build locally the newest
emacs, gnu global and sourceCodePro fonts.

In addition it will also setup the system to support the various layers provided. Currently this includes the "c/c++ layer, python layer, autocomplete layer, git layer as well as the shell layer".

I have also customized my .spacemacs file so that developing c++ code becomes much more easier i.e. providing a handy autocomplete feature set to "tab" during insert mode
or automatically cleaning your saved files from whitespace as well as autoformat them.

With this installer and config it should be easy for everyone to start working with spacemacs in a linux box.
